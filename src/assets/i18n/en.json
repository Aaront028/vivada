  "description": "This is a demo of multi-language support in Angular.",
  "cool": "Welcome to this repository! It's configured with a foundational template and a functional API connected to a GraphQL test dataset. The implementation includes comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with placeholder details. The codebase incorporates a basic model and ngxs setup, featuring simulated contact data, payload, and states. The app.component.html file includes a simple call to list contact names. Please note that this setup currently lacks any styling, but the essential files such as app.module.ts, graphql.module.ts, and the environment folder are all configured and ready to go"
